# Internship-Project
hello I am Krutika Dhande and this is my internship project
 Design and Simulation of 4-bit Processor
 
1. Processor Components:
   * ALU – Does math and logic (add, subtract, AND, OR).
   * Register File – Stores data in small registers (like tiny memory).
   * Control Unit – Decides what the processor should do (based on instructions).
   * Top Module – Connects all components together.
   * Testbench – Used to test the processor in simulation.

2. Main Features:
   * Works on clock pulses.
   * Takes instructions as input (via `opcode`).
   * Processes data using ALU.
   * Stores/loads data using registers.
   * Output can be seen in simulation (ModelSim or GTKWave).

3. Purpose:
   * Learn how basic processors work.
   * Understand digital logic and Verilog coding.
   * Practice simulation and testing.

4. Used For:
   * College mini-projects.
   * Learning computer architecture.
   * Digital electronics labs.
